+ Watch out for ...

  + Where package dependencies are installed ({dvi} and {ttx}) ...
  
    The s-u/R-actions/pkg-check action may not find them on some 
    platforms (e.g., macOS)

  + Paths on Windows runners ...

    Avoid tempdir() because latex calls choke on the paths
    => set 'texFile' in calls to, e.g., typeset()

    Sometimes also need cygwin paths rather than just 'pwd' to get
    D:/path/ rather than /d/path/.

    Main problem appears to be '~' char in paths 
    (from abbreviated Windows paths)

  + Specification of paths from env vars in step inputs.

    Use ${{ env.VAR }} rather than $VAR 
    (just as documented really)
